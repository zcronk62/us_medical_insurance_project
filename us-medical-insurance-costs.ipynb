    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I was successfully able to import the simulated U.S. medical insurance data provided by Codecademy. I then added the data to convineniently structured lists and dictionaries for descriptive analysis. I was able to disern the following important takeawys:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Smoking appears to effect the yearly cost of insurance the most. Within the data, 20.5% of clients responded as smokers. These clients paid, on average $\\$$32050.23 while non-smokers paid $\\$$8434.27. To keep insurance costs low, I would suggest clients quit smoking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* While the average age of clients in each region is relatively consistent (ranging from 38.9 to 39.5 years of age), the BMI has a much broader range and so too does the yearly cost. When looking at the charges, the southeast region pays the highs yearly insurance costs. The southeast region also has the highest average BMI. This suggests that BMI is a key contributer to insurance primiums as well as whether a client smokes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Males paid higher yearly insurance costs than females. The other numerical features are consistent between males and females in this data so the cause has yet to be revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clients with 5 children on average paid much less than other clients. They also tended to be much younger. It is not immediately apparent if the number of children is a driving contributer or if the difference is contained within the change in average age."
